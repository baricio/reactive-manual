## NestedList

![Image to be displayed](https://i.imgur.com/f5aO5HP.png)

A `NestedList` sensor component creates a nested select list UI widget. It is used for filtering results based on the current selection from a list of items.

Example uses:
* select a sub-category from a list of categories for filtering e-commerce search results.

### Usage

```js
<NestedList
  sensorId="CarCategorySensor"
  appbaseField={[this.props.mapping.brand, this.props.mapping.model]}
  title="List of Brand > Model"
  showCount={true}
  size={100}
  sortBy="asc"
/>
```

### Props

- **sensorId** `String`  
    unique id of the sensor, can be referenced when creating a combined query context in an actuator's `depends` prop.  
- **appbaseField** `Array of String`  
    DB data fields to be mapped with the component's UI options. The number of fields determine the level of nesting, in order.
- **title** `String` [optional]  
    title of the component to be shown in the UI.
- **defaultSelected** `string` [optional]  
    default selected value pre-selects an option from the list.
- **showCount** `Boolean` [optional]  
    show count of number of occurences besides an item. Defaults to `true`.
- **size** `Number` [optional]  
    control how many items to display in the List. Defaults to 100.
-  **sortBy** `String` [optional]  
    property that decides on how to sort the list items, accepts one of `count`, `asc` or `desc` as valid values. `count` sorts the list based on the count occurences, with highest value at the top. `asc` sorts the list in the ascending order of the list item (Alphabetical). `desc` sorts the list in the descending order of the term. Defaulted to `count`.


### CSS Styles API

All reactivebase components are `rbc` namespaced.

```html
<div class="rbc col s12 col-xs-12 card thumbnail rbc-search-active rbc-title-active rbc-placeholder-active rbc-singlelist">
  <h4 class="rbc-title col s12 col-xs-12">Cities</h4>
  <div class="rbc-search-container col s12 col-xs-12">
    <input type="text" class="rbc-input col s12 col-xs-12 form-control" value="" placeholder="Search City">
  </div>
  <div class="rbc-list-container col s12 col-xs-12">
    <div class="rbc-list-item row">
      <input type="radio" class="rbc-radio-item" value="London">
      <label class="rbc-label">London <span class="rbc-count">(211)</span></label>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

* SingleList component's class name is `rbc-singlelist`. Additionally, depending on the presence / absence of the `title` prop, a `rbc-title-active` or `rbc-title-inactive` class is respectively applied. Similarly for `search` and `searchPlaceholder` props, classnames of `rbc-search-active`, `rbc-search-inactive`, `rbc-placeholder-active`, `rbc-placeholder-active` are applied.
* the title element has a class name of `rbc-title`.
* the search element has a class name of `rbc-search-container`.
* the radio inputs are encapsulated inside a `rbc-list-container` class with each element having class name of `rbc-list-item`.
* the input radio element has a class name of `rbc-radio-item`.
* the label element has a class name of `rbc-label`.
* the element containing count inside the label has a class name of `rbc-count`.


### Examples

1. List with all the default props

2. List with custom sort and a default selection

3. List with show search set to true

4. List with a dependency on another sensor

5. Playground (with all knob actions)
