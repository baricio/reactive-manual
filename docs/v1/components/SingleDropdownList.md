## SingleDropdownList

![Image to be displayed](https://i.imgur.com/PGYPXf6.png)

A `SingleDropdownList` sensor component creates a radio select list UI widget. It is used for filtering results based on the current selection from a list of items.

Example uses:
* select a category from a list of categories for filtering e-commerce search results.
* filtering restaurants by a cuisine choice.

### Usage

```js
<SingleList
  sensorId="CitySensor"
  appbaseField="group.group_city.raw"
  title="Cities"
  defaultSelected="London"
  showCount={true}
  size={1000}
  sortBy="count"
  showSearch={true}
  searchPlaceholder="Search City"
/>
```

### Props

- **sensorId** `String`  
    unique id of the sensor, can be referenced when creating a combined query context in an actuator's `depends` prop.  
- **appbaseField** `String`  
    DB data field to be mapped with the component's UI options.
- **title** `String` [optional]  
    title of the component to be shown in the UI.
- **defaultSelected** `string` [optional]  
    default selected value pre-selects an option from the list.
- **showCount** `Boolean` [optional]  
    show count of number of occurences besides an item. Defaults to `true`.
- **size** `Number` [optional]  
    control how many items to display in the List. Defaults to 100.
-  **sortBy** `String` [optional]  
    property that decides on how to sort the list items, accepts one of `count`, `asc` or `desc` as valid values. `count` sorts the list based on the count occurences, with highest value at the top. `asc` sorts the list in the ascending order of the list item (Alphabetical). `desc` sorts the list in the descending order of the term. Defaulted to `count`.
- **showSearch** `Boolean` [optional]  
    whether to show a searchbox to filter the list items locally. Defaults to true.
- **searchPlaceholder** `String` [optional]  
    placeholder to be displayed in the searchbox, only applicable when the `showSearch` prop is set to true.
