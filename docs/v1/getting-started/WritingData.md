# Writing and Editing Data

Writing and updating data is a common operation that is triggered from app UIs.

ReactiveSearch and ReactiveMaps only offer components for creating read based search UIs.

In this post, we talk about a few ways to perform the Create, Update and Delete operations on the data.

## appbase-js

`appbase-js` is the javascript library from appbase.io that runs on Node.JS, UMD, React and React Native environments.

We recommend using appbase-js on a Node.JS middleware to perform the write operations.

> Note: It is important to perform write operations from a secure environment, as you don't want to expose the write credentials publically.

## REST API

If your middleware is written in a different language, you can easily use the REST API endpoints to write data into appbase.io or Elasticsearch. An example PUT endpoint for indexing a new (or overwriting an existing) document would look like:


```bash
curl -XPUT $host/$app/$type/$doc_id -d '{
   "msg": "Hello from ReactiveSearch",
   "from": "A middleware server"
}'
```
